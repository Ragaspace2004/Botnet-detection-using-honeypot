# Botnet Detection Using Honeypot

## Project Overview

Our project focuses on creating a powerful tool for detecting and mitigating botnet threats. By leveraging a multi-layered approach including honeypots and advanced pattern analysis, we can rapidly identify and respond to suspicious activities, ensuring the security of your digital assets.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask:** Powering our honeypot and packet sniffing capabilities to actively identify and analyze suspicious network activities.
- **API:** Leveraging the Hono.js framework to enable real-time alerts and notifications, ensuring swift detection and remediation of threats.
- **Database:** Integrating with Cloudflare's D1 database to store and correlate threat data, providing a centralized hub for security intelligence.
- **Vulnerability Databases:** Seamlessly integrating with existing vulnerability databases to quickly identify and address known security weaknesses.
